The "Login and Registration page with MySQL database using JSP+Servlet+JDBC+MySQL" project aims to create a secure and efficient web application for user authentication and registration. Leveraging JavaServer Pages (JSP) for dynamic web content, Servlets for handling server-side logic, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL for data storage, this project ensures a robust user management system. Users can register with the system, and their credentials are securely stored in a MySQL database. The login functionality allows users to authenticate themselves, with password encryption and validation mechanisms in place. The project combines key web development technologies to deliver a reliable and scalable solution for user authentication and registration.
